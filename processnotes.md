## Process Notes
- There are many other interesting questions in the TEDS data which I considered examining, including a measure of national identitification and degree of overall engagement in politics and the democratic process. For manageability, I chose questions that seemed most directly applicable to Cross-strait military concerns.
- Would also have been interesting to compare data to actual actions taken by Taiwanese government, or actions taken by mainland Chinese government, but this is not easy data to find or create. Same applies to attitudes of U.S. citizens regarding U.S. aid to Taiwan.
- Originally wanted to calculate major arms sales as a percentage of Taiwanese military spending, but because the Taiwanese fiscal year begins on January 1 and the U.S. fiscal year begins on October 1 of the previous year, and the U.S. data does not specify specific months where sales were made, it became too complicated to sort and synchronize with Taiwanese government budget data.
